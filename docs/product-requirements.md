# 🧭 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## **Travel Roboto: AI-Powered Travel Assistant**

---

## 1. Product Summary

**Travel Roboto** is an AI-powered travel assistant that transforms how travelers interact with their itineraries and trip documents. Instead of digging through emails, PDFs, and scattered notes, users can simply *ask questions* — “What’s my hotel check-in time?” or “Which airport do I fly into?” — and receive accurate, contextual answers drawn directly from uploaded travel documents and prior chat context.

The core problem it solves is **travel information fragmentation** — when key trip details are buried across multiple sources. Travel Roboto provides a conversational layer that centralizes access, enabling users to query their travel data naturally and intuitively.

**Value proposition:** Simplify trip organization and reduce travel stress through an intelligent, document-aware chatbot that understands your plans.

| **Contextual Q&A** | Users can ask questions about travel plans based on uploaded docs or emails. | ≥ 90% of test queries return correct or relevant info |
| **Document-Aware Chat** | Enable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with vector embeddings. | Latency ≤ 2.5s for average-length responses |
| **Stateless Architecture** | API remains stateless; all state handled client-side or via vector retrieval. | No server session state required |
| **Explainable Responses** | Model cites sources (filename + line reference). | Citations available in ≥ 80% of document-derived answers |
| **Professional Engineering Quality** | Code meets AI engineering best practices for modularity, clarity, and reliability. | Passes code reviews (ruff, mypy, pytest coverage ≥ 80%) |

### 🚫 Non-Goals

- Persistent long-term user memory or multi-device sync  
- Advanced user authentication or team collaboration features  
- Payment, billing, or large-scale infrastructure scalability  
- Full conversational personalization or recommendation engine  

---

## 3. User Personas & Use Cases

### 👩‍💼 Persona 1: Travel Organizer (Planner)

- Often books flights, hotels, and activities for group trips  
- Needs to upload confirmations (PDFs, emails) and verify logistics  
- Values organization, accuracy, and ease of retrieval  

**Key use cases:**
- Upload multiple travel confirmations  
- Ask questions like “What’s the total cost of hotels?” or “Do all flights arrive at the same airport?”  
- Get source citations for peace of mind  

### 🧳 Persona 2: Trip Participant (Traveler)

- Wants quick answers about itinerary details without checking documents  
- Uses mobile web to chat before or during travel  

**Key use cases:**
- Ask “What time is check-in?” or “Do I have free breakfast?”  
- Search by date or keyword (“Show events on June 14”)  
- View citations or summary of a document

## 4. System Architecture Overview

### 🏗️ Architecture Principles

- **Stateless FastAPI backend:** Each request is self-contained; no server memory of past interactions  
- **Composable modularity:**
```
TBD - Placeholder below...
app/
├── api/              # FastAPI routers and Pydantic schemas
├── core/             # LLM logic, RAG orchestration, prompt construction
├── services/         # Document parsing, embeddings, retrieval utilities
├── infrastructure/   # Database engine, storage, external API clients
├── interfaces/       # Web UI and frontend adapters
└── schema/           # Shared Pydantic models and validation rules
```

### ⚙️ Data Flow

1. **Frontend** (Tailwind web UI) sends user query + relevant context  
2. **FastAPI Router** receives and validates via Pydantic models  
3. **Core Layer** invokes the LLM orchestration logic:
   - Retrieve relevant embeddings from vector DB  
   - Construct contextual prompt (query + retrieved snippets)  
   - Call OpenAI (or other) LLM API  
4. **Service Layer** handles document ingestion:
   - Parse files (PDF, text, email)  
   - Generate embeddings and store in vector DB  
5. **Response** includes answer + citations; returned to UI via REST (and optionally WebSocket for streaming)

### 🔍 Vector Retrieval

- **Alpha:** pgvector on PostgreSQL (co-located with main DB)  
- **Beta:** upgrade to **Qdrant** for higher recall and filtering

## 5. Functional Requirements

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Document Upload & Parsing** | Support text, PDFs, and email content extraction | P0 |
| **Text Chunking & Embedding** | Split and embed text using OpenAI or HuggingFace model | P0 |
| **Vector Retrieval (RAG)** | Retrieve top-K relevant chunks based on similarity | P0 |
| **Contextual Q&A** | Combine query + retrieved context to form LLM prompt | P0 |
| **Citation Generation** | Include filename and page/line references | P1 |
| **Client-side History** | Cache chat locally (no server session) | P1 |
| **Error Handling** | Graceful handling of timeouts, bad inputs, or missing docs | P0 |
| **Structured Logging** | JSON logs with request_id, latency_ms, route | P0 |
| **Rate Limiting** | Basic per-user or per-IP protection | P1 |

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Performance** | Avg API latency < 2.5s for standard LLM responses |
| **Reliability** | ≥ 99% uptime target during active demo |
| **Observability** | Structured logs, correlation IDs, request latency metrics |
| **Privacy** | No PII stored; documents deleted after session (GDPR-aligned) |
| **Accessibility** | Clean web UI, minimal friction for uploads and Q&A |
| **Usability** | Conversational tone, human-readable citations, clear feedback for errors |

---

## 7. Technical Stack & Integrations

| Layer | Technology | Purpose / Rationale |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Backend Framework** | FastAPI (Python 3.11+) | Async, type-safe, lightweight REST framework ideal for stateless services |
| **Deployment** | Railway | Simple cloud deployment for portfolio-scale demo |
| **LLM Integration** | OpenAI API (GPT-4/4o) for alpha; add Anthropic Claude and open-source (e.g., Llama) for beta | Demonstrates multi-provider orchestration and prompt portability |
| **Orchestration Library** | LangChain or PydanticAI | Abstract prompt construction, RAG logic, and model invocation |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Central relational store for metadata and vector embeddings |
| **Vector Store** | pgvector → Qdrant (upgrade path) | Scalable embedding retrieval with smooth migration path |
| **Frontend** | Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JS | Lightweight, minimal UI emphasizing chat usability |
| **Logging** | Python `structlog` | Structured, context-aware observability |

### Why This Stack Works for Stateless Design

All state (conversation history, embeddings context) is externalized:
- Message state: stored in client browser  
- Document state: embedded into vector store  
- Each API request fully reconstructs context → ensures pure statelessness

## 8. Future Enhancements

| Feature | Description | Potential Impact |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Persistent Conversation Memory** | Store prior turns in vector memory to simulate continuity | Improved personalization |
| **Multi-Document Querying** | Simultaneous reasoning across multiple sources | Richer insights |
| **Role-Based Access** | Different privileges for organizers vs participants | Security, team collaboration |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | Visualize usage, query patterns, and LLM performance | Product iteration insights |
| **Multimodal Input** | Extract details from images (boarding passes, QR codes) | Broader data ingestion |
| **Offline Embedding Generation** | Reduce latency and cost by precomputing embeddings locally | Scalability, cost control |

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **LLM Context Drift** | Model misinterprets user intent after long chats | Stateless design + context window trimming |
| **Token Costs** | Excessive prompt size increases cost | Chunking + embedding filtering to minimize token load |
| **API Rate Limits** | External LLM providers throttle requests | Add backoff + caching |
| **Privacy Concerns** | Uploaded travel docs may contain sensitive info | Ephemeral storage + auto-deletion after session |
| **Parsing Errors** | PDF extraction errors lead to missing data | Use multi-library fallback (e.g., pdfminer + PyMuPDF) |
